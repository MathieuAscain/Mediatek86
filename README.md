# BTS SIO SLAM (HDN) - First year final project


*MediaTek86 is a network which manages multimedia library and its goal is to unite loans of books, DVD and CD and to develop the numeric multimedia library for all the departement.*

*As a junior developper we will be in charge in the developpement of the **desktop software application**. <br/>
Its goal is to manage each multimedia library employee by assigning them to a department and managing their absence.*

*The application will be a **single-user system** and it will be installed on a computer from the administration department.*

*As a **Data Management System** (**SGBDR** in French), I have decided using **MySQL**.*<br/>
*As an **Integrated Development Environment** (**IDE** in French), I have opted for **Visual Studio** and **C#** programming language.*
